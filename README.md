Weekly coding challenge


Java Reactive:
Submit the answers to the below questions:
1) What does Asynchrony mean in the context of Reactive Systems? 
   1) This concept in reactive systems means that the components are not dependent on other components to continue their flow process. Instead, every component executes its logic on their on time. That means that the components must know how to handle the scenarios when their request are responded to, delayed, or not responded at all.

2) What is Elasticity in contrast to Scalability? 
   1) Elasticity approach is recommended when we don't have control of the workloads, for example in public clouds environments where we can have an idea when the system will require more resources; However, we can't pre-plan the number of resources that the system will require at its peak. By contrast, the scalability approach is better when we have control or a right prediction of the workloads and we have knowledge of the system use of resources at its peak, which allows us to pre-planned the assignation of resources.   
3) Define the Actor Model?
   1) The actor model is a programming model for a distributed system. In this model, the actor takes place the object, and it is messaged-oriented and must know how to handle the incoming message from other actors and generate the corresponding output message to the request.
4) Mention a few similarities between Redux and RxJS.
   1) Redux uses the reactive paradigm to observe actions from a distance to change the state, and RxJS gives you a library-based in the reactive paradigm to accomplish the changes.
